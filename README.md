## Usage

This is a Social network for developers. You can create a developer profile/portfolio, share posts, and get help from other developers.

The app should have the following features:

- **Frontend** - Neat and User-Friendly component based Frontend, created with React and deployed using Render
- **Backend API** - JS-based API, Properly implementing routes and database connection, deployed using Render
- **Secure & Authenticated Links** - Most of the API routes are secured and cannot be accessed without proper Authentication
- **Storage** - Utilize MongoDB database for storage, Hosted on MongoDB Cloud

## Project Status

Project is: Complete

## Room for Improvement

- Frontend: I was thinking of adding an edit button inside the actions columns of both [Education](/client/src/components/dashboard/Education.js) and [Experience](/client/src/components/dashboard/Experience.js) which would need a profile-form component to be created for each one, similar to what I have for [CreateProfile](/client/src/components/profile-forms/CreateProfile.js) and [EditProfile](/client/src/components/profile-forms/EditProfile.js).

- Backend: There would need to be routes created for editing profile education and experience inside the [Profile](/routes/api/profile.js) API Route in order to complement the frontend changes.
